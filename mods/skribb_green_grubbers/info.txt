Green grubbers
by skribb / Patrik Mondolfi : skribb@gmail.com

This is nothing special. I just wanted to give the grubbers another color, a more "natural" one, if you will.

If you have any suggestions, requests, love letters etc. that you would like to send me, don't hesitate to contact me.
You may reach me via email (look in the header of the readme), or on the Dreamfall forum (forum.longestjourney.com).

And thanks to grumbel for making modding in Dreamfall possible!
